## 18.6. Infrastructure for packages with specific build systems

By *packages with specific build systems* we mean all the packages whose build system is not one of the standard ones, such as *autotools* or *CMake*. This typically includes packages whose build system is based on hand-written Makefiles or shell scripts.

The Makefile begins on line 7 to 11 with metadata information: the version of the package (`LIBFOO_VERSION`), the name of the tarball containing the package (`LIBFOO_SOURCE`) (xz-ed tarball recommended) the Internet location at which the tarball can be downloaded from (`LIBFOO_SITE`), the license (`LIBFOO_LICENSE`) and file with the license text (`LIBFOO_LICENSE_FILES`). All variables must start with the same prefix, `LIBFOO_` in this case. This prefix is always the uppercased version of the package name (see below to understand where the package name is defined).

On line 12, we specify that this package wants to install something to the staging space. This is often needed for libraries, since they must install header files and other development files in the staging space. This will ensure that the commands listed in the `LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS` variable will be executed.

On line 13, we specify that there is some fixing to be done to some of the *libfoo-config* files that were installed during `LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS` phase. These *-config files are executable shell script files that are located in *$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin* directory and are executed by other 3rd party packages to find out the location and the linking flags of this particular package.

The problem is that all these *-config files by default give wrong, host system linking flags that are unsuitable for cross-compiling.

For example: *-I/usr/include* instead of *-I$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/include* or: *-L/usr/lib* instead of *-L$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/lib*

So some sed magic is done to these scripts to make them give correct flags. The argument to be given to `LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS` is the file name(s) of the shell script(s) needing fixing. All these names are relative to *$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin* and if needed multiple names can be given.

In addition, the scripts listed in `LIBFOO_CONFIG_SCRIPTS` are removed from `$(TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin`, since they are not needed on the target.



**Example 18.1. Config script: \*divine\* package**

Package divine installs shell script *$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin/divine-config*.

So its fixup would be:

```
DIVINE_CONFIG_SCRIPTS = divine-config
```



**Example 18.2. Config script: \*imagemagick\* package:**

Package imagemagick installs the following scripts: *$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin/{Magick,Magick++,MagickCore,MagickWand,Wand}-config*

So itâ€™s fixup would be:

```
IMAGEMAGICK_CONFIG_SCRIPTS = \
   Magick-config Magick++-config \
   MagickCore-config MagickWand-config Wand-config
```

On line 14, we specify the list of dependencies this package relies on. These dependencies are listed in terms of lower-case package names, which can be packages for the target (without the `host-` prefix) or packages for the host (with the `host-`) prefix). Buildroot will ensure that all these packages are built and installed *before* the current package starts its configuration.

The rest of the Makefile, lines 16..29, defines what should be done at the different steps of the package configuration, compilation and installation. `LIBFOO_BUILD_CMDS` tells what steps should be performed to build the package. `LIBFOO_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS` tells what steps should be performed to install the package in the staging space. `LIBFOO_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS` tells what steps should be performed to install the package in the target space.

All these steps rely on the `$(@D)` variable, which contains the directory where the source code of the package has been extracted.

On lines 31..33, we define a user that is used by this package (e.g. to run a daemon as non-root) (`LIBFOO_USERS`).

On line 35..37, we define a device-node file used by this package (`LIBFOO_DEVICES`).

On line 39..41, we define the permissions to set to specific files installed by this package (`LIBFOO_PERMISSIONS`).

Finally, on line 43, we call the `generic-package` function, which generates, according to the variables defined previously, all the Makefile code necessary to make your package working.
